# Description:
It's a task for taking an array of activities, for example: {"Swimming", "Running", "Football"}
and take all the possible activities based on days without any repetitions
solved by recursion by taking each activity of the array and checking the last one,
If it's the same, don't create a new array and push the activity to it, 
If it's not the same, create a new array and push the activity to it, then call the same function with the newly created array using recursion

# Count Formula:

It's just simple by initializing a global variable with a value of 0, and on each print condition, I just add 1 to it
